This project performs number plate recognition on moving vehicle. A highway video is used to test the performance of the model.
The YOLOv8 model is trained on number plate dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fareselmenshawii/large-license-plate-dataset?resource=download
Then, the trained model(yolov8_number_plate.pt) is used to detect number plate in the highway video.
